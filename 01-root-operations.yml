# Assumes a WordPress Digital Ocean instance.

# Note: wordpress-hosts alias needs to be defined in an inventory file,
# e.g. /etc/ansible/hosts:

# [jekyll-hosts]
# bj
#
# [wordpress-hosts]
# do
#
# [mint-vms]
# mint-vm
#
# [digocean-hosts]
# d

# Also, if there is already an entry in known_hosts, running this script will produce an error:
